ER Diagram Write-up

	I decided to structure my entity-relationship diagram based on having six unique tables. Using the information provided in the prompt, it seemed fit to include entities such as Enclosures, Pets, Food, Animal Purchases, Food Purchases, and Loyalty Program. I began by determining the central table which I found was the Pets table. After this, I began adding in attributes inter each table. For example, under my Pets table, I added attributes such as four paws, fur, feathers, and beaks. I then structured the rest of the entity-relationship diagram by describing relationships connecting back to the Pets table. For example, the relationship between the Pets table and the Food table was “Eating”. Once I finished adding relationships between entities, I began to move onto crows foot notation. Using techniques used in class, I was able to implement this notation through my entity-relationship diagram. In order to use this specific notation, I referred to resources listed in the slides as a guide on how to add crows foot notation properly. My favorite example of crows foot notation in my entity-relationship diagram is under the relationship between the Enclosures table and the Pets table. Here, I used specific notation to indicate that there can only be one enclosure, but multiple pets can inhabit them. I came up with this relationship when I realized that multiple fish can live in one aquarium. Lastly, I decided to implement cardinality. This was a relatively easy task because the crow’s foot notation acted as a template. I added cardinality such as (1,1) and (1, many).
